## ⚡ Overview

**Sigma v3.6.1** is not just a chatbot—it is a **comprehensive financial operating system**. Designed for speed, privacy, and precision, Sigma unifies state-of-the-art LLMs with institutional-grade data tools in a minimalist, keyboard-centric interface.

Inspired by the aesthetics of **Claude Code** and the power of **Bloomberg Terminal**, Sigma provides a distraction-free environment where natural language commands translate instantly into rigorous financial analysis.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🖥️ Elite TUI Experience**: A "Tokyonight" themed interface with zero latency, generative autocomplete, and real-time ticker recognition.
- **🧠 Multi-Model Intelligence**: Seamlessly route queries to **OpenAI o1**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, **Gemini 1.5 Pro**, or run locally with **Ollama (Qwen 2.5)**.
- **📊 Institutional Data**: Direct integration with **Polygon.io**, **Alpha Vantage**, and **Exa Search** for hallucination-free market data.
- **📈 Quantitative Backtesting**: Built-in **LEAN Engine** support allows you to generate, test, and refine algorithmic strategies in seconds.
- **🔒 Privacy by Design**: All API keys and strategies are stored locally. No cloud dependencies. No data logging.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Ollama** (Recommended for local intelligence)
- **LEAN CLI** (Auto-installed for backtesting)

### Installation

Sigma features an autonomous **Setup Agent** that configures your environment automatically.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sigma/terminal.git
cd sigma

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch Sigma (Triggers Setup Agent)
python -m sigma
```

The Setup Agent will:
1.  Detect your hardware acceleration (Metal/CUDA).
2.  Install and pull the optimized local model (`qwen2.5:1.5b`).
3.  Configure your API keys securely in `.env`.
4.  Initialize the LEAN backtesting engine.

## 💻 Usage

Sigma is controlled via natural language or slash commands. The interface is designed for flow.

### 🔍 Market Intelligence
> "Analyze the correlation between NVDA and SMCI over the last 6 months."
> "What are the key risk factors in Apple's latest 10-K?"
> "Visualize the volatility surface for SPY options."

### 🛠️ Strategy Development
> "Backtest a mean-reversion strategy on BTC-USD using 15-minute bars."
> "Optimize parameters for a dual-moving average crossover on TSLA."

### ⚙️ System Control
- `/model <name>` - Switch active LLM (e.g., `/model gpt-4o`)
- `/clear` - Reset context window
- `/quit` - Exit session

## 🏗️ Architecture

Sigma is built on a modular, event-driven architecture designed for extensibility.

| Layer | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interface** | **Textual TUI** | Async, reactive terminal UI with custom widgets and syntax highlighting. |
| **Intelligence** | **LLM Router** | Dynamically routes queries based on complexity and cost (Local vs. Cloud). |
| **Data** | **Tool Registry** | Type-safe bridge connecting LLMs to 30+ financial data endpoints. |
| **Execution** | **LEAN Engine** | Dockerized backtesting environment for institutional-grade strategy validation. |

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration is managed via the `.env` file in your home directory (`~/.sigma/config.env`) or project root.

```ini
# Example .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
POLYGON_API_KEY=...
DEFAULT_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
